**Albums**

- [Alone - Bill Evans](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/bill-evans/alone/)
  You really feel like he could go on forever
- [Piano Works Volume 1 - François-Joël Thiollier, Claude Debussy](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/francois-joel-thiollier/piano-works-volume-1-1/)
  I’ve finally found my favourite version of _2 Arabesques: Arabesque No. 1_ and my favourite pianist for Debussy compositions. Noriko Ogawa falls just short.
- [Here In The Pitch - Jessica Pratt](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/jessica-pratt/here-in-the-pitch/)
  My most anticipated release of the year and so far my album of the year
- [Lives Outgrown - Beth Gibbons](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/beth-gibbons/lives-outgrown/)
  bring out the good headphones for this

**Songs**

- [Palhaço - Egberto Gismonti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9IH_VSg_R0)
  Contender for favourite songs of all time, linked the live version where Gismonti is at his sweetest. The studio recording to look for is the one off of Circense.
- [2 Pieces for 6 Hands: No. 2, Romance - François-Joël Thiollier, Sergey Rakhmaninov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAUxo4cGMyM)
  so glad to have found thiollier
- [Caetano Veloso - You Don't Know Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9VWTul_Pf0)

**Songs**

- Thom Yorke - Cymbal Rush
- Tried and True - Ween
- Radio No.1 - Air
  I’ve embarrassingly overlooked other songs from this record
- Kosuke Mine Quintet – Dream Eyes
  The closest something has sounded to Miles Davis’ In a Silent Way, compliments don’t get better than that and recordings don’t sound more well produced than this.

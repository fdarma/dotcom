**my notes are**
- chaotic: I have a single .md file for day to day notes
- scrappy: things written down are unfinished and ephemeral like temp storage
- simple: no care for backticks, tags, views, formulas, comments, ai, etc.

**what I use**
- .md: 
	- because I can take it anywhere
	- because bolding text and bullet points is really all I need
- sheets.google.com: 
	- because 100 columns on markdown is jank as
	- because tables are easy to reason about
	- because I need to share it with someone else

**what I want with a note taking tool**
- minimal: the ideal state is [zero decisions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/10/24/user-interface-design-for-programmers/)
- responsive: must not be fiddly, jank, or clunky
- malleable: like handing someone else a piece of paper or [an orange](https://hyperclay.com/)
- centralised: why two tool when one tool do trick
- accessible: to view it on the go
- portable: so that I have an escape plan

I think I'm ready to build something now

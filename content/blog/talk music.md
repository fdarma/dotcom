At some point around 2016 I ran into [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/RicardoMara%C3%B1a). It kick started my love for KPM Music Recorded Library, for Italian masters like Morricone, Piccioni, and Umilani.

At some point around 2017 I ran into [this blog](https://lampnoakari.jugem.cc/#gsc.tab=0). It kick started my love for MPB, Soul, Funk and more, it opened the door to Nacimento, Borges, Valle, Costa, Veloso, Azymuth, Wonder, Mayfield, Matsutoya, Otis, Blunsfield, and more.

At some point around 2022 I ran into [this publication](). It kick started my love for contemporary post rock, and deepened my love for the ambient and the drone and the noise.

At some point last year I ran into [this account](https://x.com/geordiegreep?lang=en). It kick started my love for ECM Jazz, and it opened my lazy eyes to Mitchell, Nyro, Pentangle, Jarreett, and more.

Every year I think that it doesn't get better than this and every year I prove myself wrong. 

I want to hold on to these memories and I want to pay it forward.

Until there's a proven science to making a good melody I think this space deserves to exist.
